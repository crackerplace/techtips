1)For DFS on an undirected graph with cycles and multiple edges between nodes ,we should check if the node is visited twice 
i.e while adding a node x's edges to the stack and before processing some node from the stack by popping it.Because just
ensuring that nodes visited are excluded from adding to the stack for a node x will not prevent multiple node visits as it
has loops etc.So even if dont check if the node is already visited before you push it on to the stack ,its fine but before
processing you should check if its already processed.
This issue will not arise in a tree.
