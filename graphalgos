a)Kruskals algo using disjoint set union
https://www.hackerearth.com/notes/abhinav92003/disjoint-set-union/

In Kruskal's algorithm, before adding an edge to the MST we need to check if the addition of the edge creates a cycle or not.
We can use DSU here. If the parents of the two nodes that the edge connects are same, then we know that addition of the edge will create a cycle.
